        The target objects that we want to detect are triangles and rectangles,
        in the background are line segments and circles that the model should ignore.
        Each synthetic scene contains only one target object.
        Each inference by the model generates the bounding box of the target
        object (show as the blue box), which can be compared with the true
        bounding box (show as the red box). In addition, the inference output
        contains the class of the shape (triangle vs. rectangle).
